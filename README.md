#QTwee
##Current State
The project is still a work in progress. This will be updated once the basic features are fully implemented, this means compiling Twee source with the ability to choose the used language for compilation.

##Requirements
This project relies on QMake for building, so you will need Qt to compile it.
The code does not use Qt components, only C++11 classes so it should compile anywhere.
